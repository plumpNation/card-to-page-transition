Card to page transition
=======================

I'm going on a journey through a load of bad decisions and shaking off my interaction cobwebs
to see if I can mimic a transition that we all know from material design.

Making these transitions effectively and in a way that can be easily maintained is no
small task, especially if other developers have to use and/or maintain the code.

I think the secret is in faking things, a lot.

## Many thanks

To Kirupa, whose [absolute position calculator](https://www.kirupa.com/html5/get_element_position_using_javascript.htm)
was a real time saver. Just remember to remove the margin from the element you are using as a clone.

To Google, yes boo, but the material design project made me think more about transitioning again.

As an ex flash developer these things were a norm, and even then Kirupa was saving my life and helping
me to earn a living. Hats off to you.
